Numinous Bodywork comes from clinical massage practice combining myofascial and
structural techniques, orthopedic assessments and applications, movement practices,
and osteopathic traditions. Additionally, various movement practices have informed my
understanding how the body works.

I consider my bodywork an approach rather than a modality. When treating someone, no
one technique reigns. My studies have been influenced by Visceral Manipulation,
CranioSacral Therapy, Shiatsu, the Trager Approach, Myofascial Release,
Neuromuscular Therapy, Clinical Massage and Injury Treatment, Structural Bodywork,
Swedish Massage, Abhyanga, Orthopedic Massage, and Neurofascial Release. In
learning all of these modalities, I have found my approach takes little sips of each of them
to inform my touch. The numinous approach blends these styles, creating a satisfying tea
for you to take with you, relaxed and embodied.

My curiosity of movement has been strong since very young. From climbing trees to
hitting baseballs, play has been a basis for my existence. Being highly kinesthetic, I
continue to learn how to use my body in various sport and dance, giving my body an inner
knowledge of how these movements function. The numinous approach incorporated
movement practices to strengthen and contribute to optimal health.
