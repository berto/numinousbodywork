        Numinous Bodywork is an integrative method seeking to be in touch with the wonder of
        inherent health, aligning experience with sensation, while assessing subtle movements
        within living tissue.
        </p>
        <p>
        When working with someone, the uniqueness of the individual and their relationship to
        their body in present moment is the foundation of this work. Considering the interplay of
        physical, emotional, and spiritual experience lived everyday, our individual body presents
        as various shapes throughout one day. Some of those shapes take on memory and
        history providing a common form from which each of us derives our living and moving
        experience.
        </p>
        <p>
        Pain and discomfort may arrive when our common, learned body form presents differently
        today; such as a recent accident, injury, or even just sleeping in a funny bed. Pain and
        discomfort may also show up when our body moves and breathes at a distance from our
        inherent source of health and optimal alignment of our structure, which may present as
        chronic pain and movement dysfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
        Ultimately, Numinous Bodywork attempts to bring your somatic awareness in touch with
        your movement potential. Walking pain free and with ease, we have the ability to truly
        relax, opening doors to healthy possibility. When we are fully embodied, we exist in touch
        with wonder.

        Numinous Bodywork integrates various approaches and concepts about the living body to
        access the uniqueness that is you. To begin, we briefly check in around your lived
        experience and recent movement history. From there, we assess the relationship
        between your bones and gravity. We agree on a plan for the session incorporating your
        goals and intention for the work.
        </p>
        <p>
        At the heart of Numinous Bodywork, we listen through touch to the fluid dynamics of the
        system. These dynamics include circulation, breath, neurofascial signaling, visceral
        movement and the inflammatory response. Following the subtle movement of these
        dynamics inform the direction of the work. Throughout a session, there will be contact to
        fascia at deep and superficial layers.
        </p>
        <p>
        Seeking optimal alignment provides our body with access to the inherent wisdom of our
        bones, our structure, and our movement.

            Eight Series Approach

        <p>
        Numinous Bodywork has created an 8 series approach to benefit your optimal body
        health and movement. This begins with a consultation about your significant life in
        movement history including any injuries or somatic trauma. Moving forward, we look
        towards the bones, since the bones do not lie. We look towards how your bones align
        with gravity to assess each session. Throughout the series body awareness and
        sensation is developed from deep and subtle layers.
        </p>
        <p>
        The first and last sessions takes a whole body approach, looking at you globally and
        treating you for wholeness integration. The middle sessions include various techniques to
        treat energetic expression within the body, inertial fulcrums of fluid movement, fascial
        continuity, and structural aberrations. A fully integrated system opens your body to
        inherent wisdom and movement ease.
        </p>
        <p>
        The intent of this work lies in the subtle body. If we can live within our subtle body, we can
        truly express our inherent being. Awakening our personal movement truth and expression
        brings us closer to the wonder that lies within.
